# Visualize-Insights-Using-Matplotlib
Goal: Practice chart creation and visual storytelling. Task: Plot the following using matplotlib or seaborn: Line plot, bar chart, pie chart Histogram with bins Boxplot for outlier detection

🎯 Objective
This mini-project demonstrates how to create and customize basic visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
You’ll learn to represent different types of data visually and detect trends and outliers.

📁 Dataset Used
A manually created dataset for 5 products, including:

Monthly sales (January, February)

Total sales

Customer ratings (1–5 scale)

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python 3

matplotlib.pyplot

seaborn

pandas

✅ Charts Created
Line Plot

Compares monthly sales between January and February for each product

Bar Chart

Displays total sales per product

Pie Chart

Shows each product’s share of total sales

Histogram

Visualizes distribution of customer ratings

Boxplot

Detects outliers in monthly sales data

✨ Customizations Used
Titles and axis labels

Legends and grid lines

Custom colors and markers

Adjusted figure size for better readability

📊 Sample Insights
Product C had the highest overall sales

Ratings are normally distributed between 3.8 to 4.5

February sales for Product D dipped compared to January

No major outliers detected in the sales data

🚀 Suggested Extensions
Replace static data with a real .csv from sales or survey data

Add line plots for 3+ months of data

Use Seaborn's pairplot() or heatmap() for multivariate analysis
